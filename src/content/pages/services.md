### Interior Design
Are you planning a renovation or just feel that certain aspects of your home or business need a little bit of love?  

This is where our interior design service could work for you.  We can help you fulfil the true potential of your space and leave you with an environment which suits your needs and enhances your life.  Using concept boards as our starting point we will design your space providing scale drawings, product boards, samples and colour ups if required.  We will plan your space for you, cover sourcing & buying and design bespoke furniture if it enhances the scheme.  We can even take the project through to implementation if you choose to use our project management service.

Depending on the size of your project will determine how involved we need to be so we also offer a lighter version of our interior design service.  This is a great value option for smaller projects or for people who are happy to do some of the work themselves.

The easiest way to work out the best option for you and your budget is to arrange a time to chat through your needs.

### Project Management

Managing a renovation project can be a huge task, co-ordinating workmen, ordering products and making sure everything happens with the minimum of disruption.  Once we have completed the design work for your space we can take on this role for you to ensure that the design vision is met and that mistakes are not made saving you both time and money.  We are also able to open up our directory of suppliers and trusted tradesmen to you.

### Interior Styling

Do you need help to bring your space to life? Do you have collections which you are not sure how to display? 

With our interior styling service we can curate your current possessions and help you choose the final bits & pieces which help to complete your space. People often underestimate the importance of how things are displayed yet it is true that it is the little things which make the biggest difference. 

We can also work on those larger items too. Having the correct layout in a room can take the space from awkward and clumsy to one that brings you a feeling of comfort & ease. We can work with you to make the most of your furniture and source and purchase additional items which would help to enhance your environment.

Prices from £150

### Virtual Design

The newest of our design services allows us to offer interior design at a lower price. Working remotely we still provide a full design service but you are able to save money because we are not coming to you for site visits and reviews. 

The process starts with a simple on line questionnaire followed by a call to discuss your design needs. Once you have sent us a floorplan for the room and some photographs we will prepare your concept board followed by design boards and floorpans for the room. You will still receive all the design details and samples needed to complete your room and refresh your home.

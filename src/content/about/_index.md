Based in Surrey Rachel Power Design is a design & build co-ordination company offering a comprehensive interior & event design and styling service across the Uk.  



The business was born out of Rachel's passion for design, interiors and entertaining plus her desire to make stylish living accessible to everyone.  Coming from a background in accessory design & with experience in hospitality & events, Rachel retrained in interiors a few years ago and has now set up her own design practice combining all of her passions and years of knowledge and experience.

At Rachel Power Design we specialise in residential interiors & events for both private clients and developers but also offer a commercial project service.  In both cases we offer a full bespoke service ranging from basic room styling to full project design and management.
